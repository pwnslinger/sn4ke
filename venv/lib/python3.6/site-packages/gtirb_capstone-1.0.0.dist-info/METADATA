GTIRB-Capstone
==============

Integration between GTIRB and the Capstone/Keystone libraries.

## Abstract
GTIRB explicitly does not include any notion of instructions or
instruction semantics.  In general this is desirable as most tools
have their own intermediate languages and corresponding
encoders/decoders to deal with instructions.  However, in many cases
the high-quality Capstone/Keystone decoder/encoder libraries provide
sufficient instruction information for binary analysis and
transformation.  These libraries provide exceptional coverage of
multiple ISAs and are widely used.  GTIRB-Capstone integrates GTIRB
with the Capstone disassembler and the Keystone assembler allowing for
transparent access to instructions in GTIRB instances.

## Dependencies

This package requires:

 - [keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone.git)
   To install keystone run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone.git
   cd keystone
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../make-share.sh
   make install
   ldconfig
   ```

## Development
You can create a virtual environment for development using tox:
```
tox -e venv
. venv/bin/activate
``

This repository uses pre-commit to enforce code formatting. You should
have pre-commit installed. To activate pre-commit in this repository run:

```
pre-commit install
```

To run the tests execute tox:
```
tox
```
